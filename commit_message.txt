ci(deploy): implement manual rollback and optimize deployment workflow

- Add manual rollback workflow for controlled version rollbacks
- Configure GCS bucket lifecycle for backup management
- Update database configuration to use DATABASE_URL
- Optimize Docker build with dummy DATABASE_URL for collectstatic
- Implement database backup and restore scripts with DATABASE_URL support
- Add secure secret key generation script
- Replace hardcoded test secret key with GitHub secret
- Implement environment-specific data seeding
- Add OWASP ZAP security scanning
- Improve workflow dispatch options for manual control

This change provides a more robust deployment strategy with:
- Manual rollback capability for specific versions
- Automated rollback for failed deployments
- Improved database backup management
- Better environment variable handling
- Enhanced deployment safety measures
- Secure test environment configuration
- Automated security scanning
- Environment-specific data seeding

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Database configuration now requires DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Test environment requires TEST_SECRET_KEY GitHub secret
- Manual rollback workflow replaces automatic rollback
- Environment-specific data seeding requires new seed commands
- OWASP ZAP scanning requires .zap/rules.tsv configuration

Implementation History:
1. Initial deployment workflow with automatic rollback
2. Added database backup and restore functionality
3. Implemented manual rollback workflow
4. Added secure secret management
5. Integrated OWASP ZAP security scanning
6. Added environment-specific data seeding
